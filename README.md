# 42Hive-Fractol
<p>This graphics project displays visual representations of the imaginary plane based on different ecuations. </p>
<p>These representations result in fractals; infinitely self-repeating patterns.</p>
<p>Available Fractals:</p>
<p>&emsp;Mandelbrot</p>
<p>&emsp;Julia set of Mandelbrot</p>
<p>&emsp;Burning Ship</p>
<p>&emsp;Julia set of Burning Ship</p>
<p>&emsp;Celtic</p>
<p>&emsp;Melting Mandelbrot</p>
<p>&emsp;Melting Ship</p>
<p>&emsp;Melting Celtic</p>

<p>Julia sets use the same ecuations but the starting point of tha calculations is the position of the mouse, instead of a fixed one.</p>
<p>There is also versions of all three fractals where the mouse position afects the calculation that I called "Melting"</p>
<p>The fractals may be zoomed in "infinitely", up to the limit of 'double' decimals calculations.</p>
